# Synpsis
The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the project structure and make the minimum changes so that you can hava a successful build on the `main` branch.

# Clean
1. You first need to have clean repository, i.e. no changes. You have to commit everything you have worked on:
```
git add .
git commit -m "describe your changes"
```

2. Make sure you are on the main branch: `git checkout main`

# Prepare
1. Get the code. To get updates from github, you just need to run `git pull`. You should now see lab02 folder. 
2. Go to the folder (in the terminal, `cd lab02`)
3. Prepare the build:
  * For Linux/Mac, run: `cmake .`
  * For Windows, run: `cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"`

# Project structure
The project is split into several classes organized in several files. The `main.cpp` is the entry point of the program. __You should not make any changes to the `main.cpp`.__

## Classes
Each class is split into two files:
* `something.h`  - the header files (i.e. `*.h`) contains the declaration of the class, its member functions and variables. It is `included` via the `#include` directive in other `.cpp` files.
* `something.cpp` - the CPP file contains the definition of the class member functions. It is what is actually compiled

There are 4 classes in the program:
* `Invoice` - responsible for the state of the invoice being prepared, i.e. the products, quantities, totals, etc. It uses the `Item` class to keep track of product quantities. and is used by the `TextPrinter` class.
* `Item` - responsible for tracking quantity and a subtotal of a given product, i.e. a line item of an invoice. It uses the `Product` class and is used by the `Invoice` class.
* `Product` - responsible for the information about the product, i.e. name and price.
* `TextPrinter` - responsible for printing invoice information to an output stream (e.g. `cout`). It uses the `Invoice` member functions to extract and present the information.

The `main.cpp` gives you the frame. In order to make it work and compile, you will need to make several changes to the class files. 

# Exercise

You should work in small iterations towards completing the exercise. I will illustrate the steps with a few examples, and then you should try on your own until you get to the final result.

The steps that we will be repeating are the following:
1. Build the program with `make` on Mac/Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows.
2. Look at the first error.
3. Fix the first error so it dissapears (i.e. the code compiles, changes only in the `.h` files)
4. Go to #1 until no more errors during compilation.
5. Build the program with `make` on Mac/Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows.
7. Linking fails - look at the first error and fix it by making changes in the `.cpp` files. Define empty member functions - don't try to implement them, our goal is to produce an executable.

Basically, when you repeat the process above several times, you will have an executable file `lab1.exe` on Windows or `lab` on Linux/Mac that doesn't do anything. 

# Example Steps

Build: `make` on Mac/Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows

You will see errors. The first time, you should see something like:

Look at the first error:

/Users/kiril.vuchkov/uni/CITB205-2020/lab2/src/main.cpp:7:13: error: no matching constructor for initialization of 'Product'
    Product superMob("Super Mob", 12.90);
            ^        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~

It indicates that there is no constructor for the Product class. Go to `product.h` and declare it:
```c++
class Product {
public:
    Product(string name, double price);
};
```

Notice that the constructor function ends with a semicolon - we will not provide a body at this point.

Build: `make` on Mac/Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows

There is not add member function of the Invoice class. Go to `invoice.h` and declare it:
```c++
class Invoice {

    void add(Product product, int quantity);
};

Only one error remains now - there is no print member function in the TextPrinter class - go to `textprinter.h` and declare it:

Voila! We have successfully compiled everything. However, the linking fails. Let's keep iterating.

It is actually one error, but with a few problems in it. The problem is that we have declared member functions, but we haven't defined their bodies anywhere.
When the compiler tries to link the program, it expects to find the definitions of the declared functions in some of the `.o` files produced by the compilation phase.

Let's add the first body (`TextPrinter::print`). Go to `textprinter.cpp` and add it:
```c++
void TextPrinter::print(std::ostream &out, Invoice invoice) {}
```
Note that when we provide definitions (i.e. body) for member functions we prefix the name of function with the name of the class.

Now we need to go to `invoice.cpp` and `product.cpp` and add the empty function bodies:
```c++
void Invoice::add(Product product, int quantity) {}
```

```c++
Product::Product(string name, double price) {}
```

Let's build one last time - `make` on Mac/Linux or `mingw32-make` on Windows:

# The End

Voila! We have completed the exercise and have an executable file. Now you can run it (it will do nothing, for now):
* Windows: `lab1.exe`
* Mac/Linux: `./lab1`
